### Solutions (From Last Week)
We'll go over these together in class.

### Intro
This week's work reviews over some portions of the exam I found that might've been troublesome for some, or required a lot of thinking behind it. If you'd 
like to refer to it, [here](https://github.com/joegreene/Spring-2014-CS-Lab--SI-/tree/master/Week%208) are Week 8's notes (on while/do-while/for loops).

### Midterm Review Questions

Work with a partner (or your row) to solve the questions listed in the file named `Questions.md` above on the list, or click [here](questions.md).

### Practice Assignments
1. Try to print out a diamond and  using the same techniques as we did for printing a square and triangle. HINT: Try splitting the diamond in half.
2. Using the same logic from the Tic-Tac-Toe game we made, try to make a Connect-Four game.
3. Conditional Ping-Pong (dear lawd)

### Extra Challenges
TBD
