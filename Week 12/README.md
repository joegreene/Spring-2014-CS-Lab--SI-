### Intro
Today's SI session will be split up into two sections: One to briefly go over loops and talk about shape-printing, and the other half to talk about arrays 
(a topic that'll be gone over in the lecture today). There is an optional third section too (which is not part of the core curriculum, but really handy 
to know), dealing with file input/output (IO).

As a side note: I don't know if you all have realized this yet, but I made the topics on the top work as links. This means you can click the blue text and it 
will automatically jump you to its section, instead of needing to scroll all the way down to get to each section.

### Loops Review & Shape-Printing
Located [here](../blob/master/Week%2012/Loops.md).

### Arrays Preview

### File Input/Output (IO)
Located [here](../blob/master/Week 12/File_IO.md).

### Practice Assignments
These are all listed under their relevant note pages, except for [this](#github tic-tac-toe) one, which will help with honing-in on using both loops and if-else checks 
if you wish to do so.
