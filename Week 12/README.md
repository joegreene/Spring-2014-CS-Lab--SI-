### Intro
Today's SI session will be split up into three sections: One to briefly go over loops, another to talk about shape-printing, and a third to talk about arrays (a topic that'll be gone over in the lecture today). There is a fourth section I planned, although I didn't have enough time to type it up completely.

As a side note: I don't know if you all have realized this yet, but I made the topics on the top work as links. This means you can click the blue text and it 
will automatically jump you to its section, instead of needing to scroll all the way down to get to each section.

### Loops Review
Located [here](Loops.md).

### Shape Printing
Located [here](Shape_printing.md).

### Arrays Preview
Located [here](Arrays.md).

### File Input/Output (IO)
I didn't have enough time to finish this page for this week (and I didn't think we would get to this in time). Week 13 has notes on this.

### Practice Assignments
These are all listed under their relevant note pages.

### Extra Challenges
If you haven't yet, check out the File IO notes listed above (incomplete though).

If the schedule allows it, we might be able to make a game of [tic-tac-toe](http://xoax.net/cpp/crs/console/lessons/Lesson9/) together. If you end up 
somehow finishing all the other material on this page, you can try this tutorial out. It's a video tutorial, however, so you'll have to either find another elsewhere 
without two-dimensional arrays (a topic we will cover either next week or the one after), or
