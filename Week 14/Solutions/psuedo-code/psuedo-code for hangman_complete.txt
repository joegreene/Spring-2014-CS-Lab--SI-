Create phrase list and set its size to some arbitrary value
Ask user for filename

If the file was opened
  While there are lines to grab AND we haven't exceeded the phrase list limit
    Input each phrase into the phrase list
    Increase phrase counter
  Set toggle for made_list to true
  Close file
Else (file was not opened)
  Tell the user the file was not opened
  Set toggle made_list to false
    
If the list was initialized
  Initialize grid
  Initialize other variables
  Initialize correct phrase from a random string in the list
  Initialize masked phrase using correct phrase

  While game is running
    Print hangman grid
    Prompt masked phrase
    Prompt amount of wrong letters
    Prompt number of tries left
    
    If guessing
      Ask for a letter
      If the input is a letter
        Scan the correct phrase for occurrences of letter input
          If the letter input is in the correct phrase
            Set the corresponding position in masked phrase to input and set toggle in_phrase to true
            
        If the letter input was in the phrase
          Reset toggle in_phrase to false
          If the masked phrase now equals the correct phrase
            Set toggle for is_guessing to false
            Toggle for guessed_right is true
            
        Else (if input was not in the phrase)
          Scan the wrong input list to see if the letter input is in there
            If the input is in the wrong list
              Set toggle for in_wrong to true
          
          If the input was already in the wrong list
            Set toggle for in_wrong to be false (do nothing with 
          Else
            Add input to wrong list
            Add a space afterwards (for cleanliness)
            Decrease number of guesses left
            Add body part to grid corresponding to the amount of guesses lost
            If the number of guesses is less than (or equal to) zero
              Set toggle for is_guessing to false
              
    Else if the user guessed right
      Congratulate the user
      Set is_playing toggle to false
    
    Else (user guessed wrong)
      Tell the user they lost and tell them the correct phrase
      Set is_playing toggle to false
