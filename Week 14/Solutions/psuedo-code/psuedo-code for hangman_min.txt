  Prompt number of tries left
  
  If guessing
    Ask for a letter
    If the input is a letter
      Scan the correct phrase for occurrences of letter input
        If the letter input is in the correct phrase
          Set the corresponding position in masked phrase to input and set toggle in_phrase to true
          
      If the letter input was in the phrase
        Reset toggle in_phrase to false
        If the masked phrase now equals the correct phrase
          Set toggle for is_guessing to false
          Toggle for guessed_right is true
          
      Else (if input was not in the phrase)
        Scan the wrong input list to see if the letter input is in there
          If the input is in the wrong list
