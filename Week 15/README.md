### Intro
Since it's finals week, majority of this page consists of review work. Today's page starts off with review of the material you all wanted to go over, 
following into functions.

### Review Work
Check [here](review.md).

### Functions
These are essential to look over if you're planning on taking CS 121. If you're not, I still say it's worth a shot to learn about because it makes typing 
similar code a lot easier. Reusability is key here. The page is located [here](functions.md) or above.


### Extra Challenges
If you feel comfortable with all the material so far (and I urge you to be comfortable with it as next week is finals week), see if anyone else may need help. You might 
learn a thing or two when helping your peers out, or even realize you need to review a topic or two.
