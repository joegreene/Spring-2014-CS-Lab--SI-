### Intro
Since it's finals week, majority of this page consists of review work. Today's page starts off with review of the material you all wanted to go over, 
following into functions.

### Review Work
I've included pages on the material you all requested to look over. Each of the following pages has questions to go over, in which we will go over the answers afterwards. I 
tried to make it look similar to your midterm.

Answer as many questions as you can before referring to notes. If you use your notes the entire time, you're either giving yourself a false sense of security or  are seriously 
behind in the work. Remember: Review is supposed to improve your memory, not show-off your reference skills. The page is located [here](review.md) or above.

__NOTE:__ I doubt that anything past arrays (such as File IO and user-defined functions) will be on the final exam. Although they're worth knowing to be safe, because they are primarily 
CS 121 topics (and that Professor Tian said so a couple of times that they would not be on the exam), worry more about the other material first. __Arrays and topics before arrays are fair game!__

if/else/switch
loops
arrays

### Functions
These are essential to look over if you're planning on taking CS 121. If you're not, I still say it's worth a shot to learn about because it makes typing 
similar code a lot easier. Reusability is key here. The page is located [here](functions.md) or above.


### Extra Challenges
If you feel comfortable with all the material so far (and I urge you to be comfortable with it as next week is finals week), see if anyone else may need help. You might 
learn a thing or two when helping your peers out, or even realize you need to go over a specific topic.
