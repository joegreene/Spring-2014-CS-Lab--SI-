DO NOT USE NOTES UNLESS INSTRUCTED!
I.	Short Answer
1.	List the three types of loops and their differences. In what situations are each preferable over the others?
2.	Describe the differences between a switch statement and if-else chain. Give an example of when one would be preferable over the other (and vice-versa).
3.	What are different types of program errors? Please give one example for each type. How should we debug for different types of errors? 
4.	What is the difference between a one-dimensional and two-dimensional array? What is a partially-filled array? Draw a diagram of a partially filled two-dimensional 3x3 array (any values) and an empty one-dimensional array of size 5. 
5.	What is a loop inside a loop called? Give an example of when this would be necessary.
6.	What is an off-by-one error? What is a counter? What is an accumulator? What is a sentinel? How do we get the size of an one-dimensional array?
7.	What does it mean to use the static_cast operator on a variable? Give an example of when using static_cast would be necessary.
II.	Multiple Choice
1.	What does the following line output to the screen?

int stuff[] = {2, 3, 4, 1};
cout << stuff[3];
a. 4
b. 1
c. 2
d. 3
2.	Assuming ar is initialized and is 5 x 5, what is the output of the following code?
for(int c = 0; c < 3; ++c) {
	for(r = 0; r < 3; r++)
		cout << ar[c][r] << " ";
	cout << endl; 
}
a.	Prints out each row of ar per line
b.	Prints out each column of ar per line
c.	Does not compile
d.	None of the above
3.	A byte consists of how many bits?
a.	6
b.	7
c.	8
d.	9
e.	10

4.	What is the value of total after the following statements are executed?
	int total, i;
	total = i = 0;
	for(int i = 0; i <= 5; ++i)
		total+=i; 15
a.	5
b.	10
c.	0
d.	Compiler error

5.	What is the output of the following code?
for(int r = 0; r < 3; r++)
	for(int c = 0; c < 4; c++)
		cout<<"*";

a.	****
b.	************
c.	None of the options
d.	****
****
****

6.	What is the value of sum after running the following code?
int sum = 0;
while(true)
{
	if(sum > 0)
		break;
	else
		sum+=1;
}

a.	4
b.	0
c.	1
d.	Infinite loop (sum infinitively increases)

7.	What is the output of the following code?
int hello = 3.14;
double div = static_cast<double>(hello)/2;
cout << div << endl;

a.	1.57
b.	1
c.	1.5
d.	3.14


8.	Which of the following statements is NOT legal?
a. int array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
b. double list[5] = {5.5, 3.14};
c. char grid[][2] = { {1}, {2} };
d. string crossword[2][] = { {4}, {5} };

9.	What is the value of x after the following statements?
int x;
x = 25/7;

a.	15
b.	3
c.	4
d.	3.75

10.	What is the value of x after the following statements, assuming the array z has values 1, 2, 5, 4, 3 inside of it?
int x = -999;
for(int i = 0; c < 5; ++c)
	if(x < x[c])
		x=x[c];
a.	5
b.	1
c.	-999
d.	None of the above
