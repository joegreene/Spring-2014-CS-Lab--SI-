### Intro
This page hosts the review work. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. The material below is intended to be a cooperative assignment, 
and hopefully helps you study for the upcoming final. If you have any questions about the work, final, or anything related to the course, please 
don't hesitate to ask.

### Review Work
If I didn't get a chance to pass out the actual informal exam, check out [this](psuedoexam.txt) or click [here]() for a .doc version. 
I tried to make it have a similar format to the midterm exam (assuming the final will be of the same format).

I'm not sure if it will be on the final, but it would be a good idea to review the past midterm and the terminology from that section. Everyone 
said that was the toughest section of the midterm exam, and it wouldn't surprise me if Professor Tian questions similar to those on the final exam.

### Extra Challenges
If you finish and feel comfortable about all the review work, take a look at the functions page (either [here](functions.md) or navigate through 
the main page to it).
