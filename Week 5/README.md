### Exercise & Setup

As usual, load up Visual Studio and create a project using the "Win32 Application" option.

Make sure to set the directory to your desktop, so you can easily refer to the files outside
of the IDE.

If you get done early, please help a friend nearby. If you don't have any, and can
bear making new ones, find and make one then help them out.

### Intro

In the lecture and lab, we saw a little bit of how variables work. For instance:

```C++
  int age;
  age = 17;
```

assigns the value `17` to the integer `age`. Also,

```C++
  cout << age << endl;
```

resulted in the console printing out `17`.

### Variables
Like in math, variables are items that can hold values. Unlike math though, in computer 
science a variable can be reassigned a different value later on.

Remember that variables are names for locations in memory and that computers do things 
step by step. 

Variables have three parts to them: Data types, identifiers, and the value assigned to each 
variable.

#### Identifiers & Naming Scheme
When creating variables, you always need to an identifier assigned to each. 


#### Data Types
Although there are MANY different types of data types, you won't be using every single one 
in this course. There are five, however, that come up the most often. These are:
'int', 'double', 'char', 'string', and 'bool'.

It's good to know the other types, such as 'float', although you won't be seeing them 
as much.

We'll go over the main five in the following sections.

##### Integers
Known in syntax as `int`, integers are numbers such as `0, 1, -3, ...` and so on.

##### Doubles
The `double` data type is like the `int` data type, except
